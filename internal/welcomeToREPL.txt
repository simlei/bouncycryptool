=   Welcome to the JCrypTool project / build console!   =
=========================================================

You are in a Scala console here! Everything is a Scala expression.
That means you can actually learn something about this language here.
It is kind of like Java, with more powerful syntax.

- Try evaluating pure Scala code (at the basic level it is like Java)
    e.g. scala> 4+4
         scala> println("Helloworld!")

- Try working with Scala and the JCrypTool model's file structure:
    e.g. scala> jct.core.dir // shows the location of the core repository
    e.g. scala> (jct.core.dir ** "*.java").get.take(20) // first 20 java files found in "core"
    e.g. scala> val helloFile = jct.core.dir.parentFile / "hello.txt"
                IO.write(helloFile, "Hello, world!")
                println(s"$helloFile reads: " + IO.read(helloworldFile))

- Try building JCrypTool (like a weekly build)
    e.g. scala> jct.core.api.buildJCTProduct(jct.core.dir.parentFile / "myWeeklyBuild")
                (the '/' is perfectly valid Scala code in this context for denoting subfolders)

- Read more help and how to navigate here:
         scala> jct.help

At any point, press the TAB key to see auto-completions.

To quit the console, use the "exit" command.

Have fun!
