# SBT-core-only workflow 

One of the most simple workflows in open source is to change code where you know better than the current state, test if it works out, and be done with it. This is exactly what you will find here. With it you will be able to modify: 

 - Cryptographic bindings to the BouncyCastle library and how they are parametrized
 - Change the help and documentation available to the user across different interfaces
 - Really anything that is not specific to the JCrypTool Rich Client Platform plug-in

## Setup

[Make sure to have the required tools installed.](Basic+development+tools.html) Besides Java, that would be git and SBT.
