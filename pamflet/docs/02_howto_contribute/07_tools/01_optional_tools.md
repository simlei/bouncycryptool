# Optional tools: 

## Maven

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) is for building JCrypTool and, especially, its target platform so it can be used by SBT to build and test the UI-related parts of the BCT project.

For windows users:
    1) Download binary zip file extract at an installation location (e. g. <USER_HOME>/installations/)
    2) [Add the "bin" subfolder to your environment variables ("Maven in PATH").](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/windows-prerequisites.html)
       (Open Windows System Control (Systemsteuerung) and enter "PATH" in the search field in the upper right of the window)
