# Basic development tools

Because all workflows use a common denominator of tools, this section lists them and how to install them. Choose a workflow from one of the previous chapters and use these pages as a reference on where to find and how to install the required tools.

# Required tools

## Java 8

[Java Development Kit version 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

## Git

Git is for fetching the code from github. On most Linux-based systems, it is already installed. [For Windows users, this works quite well](https://git-scm.com/download/win), but really any distribution which works in the standard "cmd" is good. Personally, I have not made the best experience with the GitHub distribution however.
