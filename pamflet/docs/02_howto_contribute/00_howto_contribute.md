## How to contribute

There are be various ways to contribute to BCT, as with any Open-Source project. Besides testing and reporting issues, to contribute code to those facets you need the necessary development tools to test your code. You won't need to set up all the development tools for those facets all at once:

 - In the simplest case w.r.t. the development process involved, you would want improve on the cryptographic routines that Bouncy Castle provides and that BCT uses, or on the documentation. This is called the "Core-only workflow".

 - Going more complex, if you want to contribute to the BCT core as well as to the JCrypTool plug-in and graphical interface, that's great -- this is the "full setup" though. You would need to set up the Eclipse Plug-in development environment for JCrypTool additionally to the BCT-required setup. We have taken care of some hard stuff with simple automations for you already. We call this the "workflow with UI and eclipse PDE".
