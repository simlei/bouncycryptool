# BouncyCrypTool for developers

Welcome to the BouncyCrypTool documentation for developers! 

## What does the name mean?

"BouncyCrypTool" aims to give the [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) cryptographic library an interface (or really: multiple interfaces) that are as easy to use for end users and developers alike, and extend the [JCrypTool](cryptool.org/en/jcryptool) project as a means to provide a user interface.

 - For developers, that means an API, written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), usable by Scala and Java applications alike

 - For end-users, it offers both a command-line interface as well as a graphical user interface. JCT is an Eclipse Rich Client Platform project. BCT provides a plug-in to integrate its user interface functionality to the already mature cryptographic environment that is JCrypTool.
